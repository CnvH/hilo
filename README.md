testing git access from pycharm
Nothing to see here.  Just horsing about with pycharm and git like you do...

Named the branch as 'Master' on pycharm but created the repo with the main branch as 'Main'

Created this file in GitHub and making this edit in PyCharm

Changed master to default branch and deleted the unused main branch.  PyCharm knows the Master branch 
and so nothing had to change locally.
